# [modern-botok](https://github.com/Divergent-Discourses/modern-botok)
This repository offers a customised dictionary (dictionary/tsikchen.tsv) and contains an explanation of how to integrate the customised dictionary into BoTok.
Botok out-of-the-box can tokenize classical Tibetan text or traditional genres, however since it depends on a dictionary for tokenization, lacks capabilities for modern Tibetan, in particular, the language of modern newspapers published in the PRC or on the sub-continent. Adding this customised dictionary adds functionality for modern Tibetan to BoTok. The modern-botok dictionary file, [tsikchen.tsv](https://zenodo.org/records/14034747), has also been published on Zenodo.

## Dictionaries 
- The modern_botok dictionary was compiled from [Christian Steinert's collection](https://github.com/christiansteinert/tibetan-dictionary/tree/master/_input/dictionaries/public) and contains the following dictionaries: 
  1. Grand Monlam Dictionary (default dictionary of Botok)
  2. [Jim Valby](https://github.com/christiansteinert/tibetan-dictionary/blob/master/_input/dictionaries/public/07-JimValby)
  2. [Ives Waldo](https://github.com/christiansteinert/tibetan-dictionary/blob/master/_input/dictionaries/public/08-IvesWaldo)
  3. [Dan Martin](https://github.com/christiansteinert/tibetan-dictionary/blob/master/_input/dictionaries/public/09-DanMartin)
  4. [Tshig mdzod chen mo](https://github.com/christiansteinert/tibetan-dictionary/blob/master/_input/dictionaries/public/25-tshig-mdzod-chen-mo-Tib)
  5. [Dung dkar](https://github.com/christiansteinert/tibetan-dictionary/blob/master/_input/dictionaries/public/34-dung-dkar-tshig-mdzod-chen-mo-Tib)
  6. [Tibetan Terminology Project](https://github.com/christiansteinert/tibetan-dictionary/blob/master/_input/dictionaries/public/48-TibTermProject
)
- The resulting dictionary was cleaned up and edited by the Divergent Discourses project to the project's requirements (removal of double entries, phraseologisms, ungrammatical entries, etc; addition of ca. 1000 personal and place names)
